# $20 Credit System Implementation for First Token Generation
**Date:** September 15, 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented a promotional credit system that rewards users with $20 when they generate their first token within 3 minutes of registration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
Added credit tracking to User model:
- `creditBalance`: Tracks available credits
- `firstTokenAt`: Records when first token was generated
- `promotionEligible`: Boolean flag for eligibility
- `promotionClaimed`: Boolean flag for claim status

Created Credit model for transaction history:
- Stores all credit transactions
- Tracks type (PROMOTIONAL, PURCHASED, REFUND, ADJUSTMENT)
- Includes description and expiry date

### 2. Credit Service (`/lib/credit-service.ts`)
Core service for managing credits:
- `applyFirstTokenPromotion()`: Awards $20 if within 3-minute window
- `checkPromotionEligibility()`: Returns eligibility and time remaining
- `addCredit()`: General credit addition function
- `useCredits()`: Deducts credits for API usage
- `getUserCredits()`: Retrieves balance and history
- `calculateInferenceCost()`: Calculates cost per model/tokens

### 3. API Integration (`/app/api/inference/route.ts`)
Enhanced inference endpoint to:
- Track first token generation time
- Automatically apply $20 credit if eligible
- Deduct credits from balance for API usage
- Return credit information in response

### 4. Onboarding Experience (`/components/onboarding/onboarding-welcome.tsx`)
Added promotional features:
- Prominent countdown timer showing time remaining
- Real-time promotion banner with $20 offer
- Visual feedback when credit is earned
- Progress tracking with credit status
- Animated alerts and chips for urgency

### 5. Billing Dashboard (`/components/billing/billing-dashboard.tsx`)
Credit visibility features:
- Credit balance card in overview
- Credit history with transactions
- Alert banner for available credits
- Transaction details with timestamps

## Key Features

### User Experience
- **Clear Value Proposition**: $20 credit prominently displayed
- **Urgency**: 3-minute countdown creates action incentive
- **Visual Feedback**: Success celebrations when earned
- **Transparency**: Full transaction history available

### Technical Implementation
- **Atomic Transactions**: Database consistency maintained
- **Time Tracking**: Precise 180-second window enforcement
- **Automatic Application**: No manual steps required
- **Balance Management**: Credits automatically applied to usage

## Business Impact

### Expected Benefits
1. **Increased Activation**: Users motivated to complete first API call quickly
2. **Reduced Time-to-Value**: 3-minute target accelerates onboarding
3. **Lower CAC**: $20 credit offset by increased conversion rates
4. **Better Engagement**: Credits encourage platform exploration

### Success Metrics
- First token generation rate within 3 minutes
- Time from registration to first API call
- Credit utilization rate
- User retention after credit exhaustion

## Next Steps

### Required for Production
1. Set up actual PostgreSQL database
2. Run Prisma migrations
3. Implement real payment processing
4. Add credit expiration logic
5. Create admin dashboard for credit management

### Recommended Enhancements
1. A/B test different credit amounts
2. Add referral credit system
3. Implement tiered promotions
4. Create credit purchase flow
5. Add credit notifications/emails

## Uncertainty Map

### Least Confident About
- **Credit Amount Optimization**: $20 might be too high/low depending on actual usage patterns and unit economics
- **Time Window**: 3 minutes chosen arbitrarily, needs data-driven validation
- **Expiration Policy**: 30-day expiry might need adjustment based on user behavior

### Oversimplifications
- Mock data for billing/usage instead of real metrics
- Simplified cost calculation model
- No consideration for different regions/currencies
- Basic transaction types without refund workflows

### Questions for Validation
- What's the actual cost per token for different models?
- What's the target CAC and LTV for this promotion?
- Should credits expire or roll over?
- How to handle abuse/gaming of the system?
- Integration with Stripe or payment processor?
